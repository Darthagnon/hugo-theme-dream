## Version history
See [the Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md) for breaking changes and important announcements. See [here](docs/compatibility&known-issues.md) for browser compatibility and known issues.

## Installation

Go into your blog folder and run:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream.git dream
```

Then open your `config.toml` and edit the `theme` parameter to `theme = "dream"` and save. Your site will now build like a dream with this theme!

We recommend copying the content of `/exampleSite/` into your site's root, which will give you an example `config.toml` and content pages demonstrating the folder layout your site should follow. 

## Publishing

See [Hugo: Hosting & Deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/).

This theme is compatible with [netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) (and hence should also be compatible with forks like [StaticCMS](https://www.staticcms.org/)).

You can also use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) to host static websites for free.

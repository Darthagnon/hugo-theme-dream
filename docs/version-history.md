## The next version is out

> If you still want to use the old version, you can check out the branch to `release-1.6`.

The new version brings some new design elements and bug fixes. When it stabilizes, it will be released as `v2.0.0`.

All changes will be committed to the `master` branch. You can check the screenshot below to see the rough interface changes.

For more detail, please refer to the [Release v2.0.0-beta](https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta).

## Note After v1.1.0

> It's needed to set the **`about`** folder to **`Headless Bundle`**.

## Major update in 2019-11-10

I completely rewrite the page layout to [masonry layout](https://masonry.desandro.com/).

Correspondingly, the configuration (`config.toml`) also has some breaking changes.

Please refer to the documentation for details.
